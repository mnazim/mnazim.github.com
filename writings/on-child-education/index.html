        <p><em>(This is an incomplete work, Only purpose of this page is to serve as a place to collect my thoughts.)</em></p>
<div class="section" id="you-can-live-without-telivision">
<h2>You can live without telivision</h2>
<p>Unplug your TV set, pick it up, take it out, and smash it and burn it beyond salvage. Period. No excuses. Disadvantages of TV are far greater than the advantages and those advantages can easily be replaced with better alternatives. Want your children to learn from Discovery Channel - everything available on DVD and P2P networks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="schools-are-evil">
<h2>Schools are evil</h2>
<p>Don't send them off to schools. Schools will damage your child in the ways you cannot imagine. Just like TV, the disadvantages of the schools system far outweigh the advantages. You want your children to learn social skills, encourage them to go to parks and play with other kids in your residential locality.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reading-and-writing-are-primary-skills">
<h2>Reading and writing are primary skills</h2>
<p>Teach you children to read and write a couple of languages.(your native language, English, and may be one more language of your liking). The key is to start early; you will be amazed to see how fast your 2 year old kids can pick-up reading, even before they start speaking properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="books-are-awesome">
<h2>Books are awesome</h2>
<p>Now give them books. Lot's of them. Not computers, not iPads. The actual physical, paper books. Read with them; write with them but don't force them. Start slow, not more than 30 minutes, once or twice a week. Build up their curiosity a few pages at a time.</p>
<!-- Mastakes are tools; use them -->

<!-- Once they are adults, let them and encourage them make their own decisions. -->

<!-- Now, what about those are not fortunate enough to have literate parents and/or have to give up education for earning the basic survival - a real problem in our sub-continent. Identify such kids in your locality; form a group of literate people; GOTO Step 0 above. Encourage your friends and relatives to form similar groups in their respective localities. -->

<!-- Now what about schools completion certificates. The only certificate your child will ever need is the completion of High School and/or Senior School. National Open School is one such alternative. -->
